A limit describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a particular value.\n\nConsider the function f(x) = x². As x approaches 2, what happens to f(x)? We can see that f(x) approaches 4. We write this as:\n\nlim(x→2) x² = 4\n\nThe formal definition uses epsilon-delta notation, but intuitively, we're asking: \"What value does f(x) get arbitrarily close to as x gets arbitrarily close to some number a?\"\n\n\n## Limit Laws\n\n\n\n## Quotient Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) / g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) / lim(x→a) g(x), provided lim(x→a) g(x) ≠ 0\n\n\nThese rules allow us to break down complex limit problems into simpler parts.\n\n\n## Derivatives\n\n",

It states that if f is continuous on [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f, then:\n\n∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)\n\nThis allows us to evaluate definite integrals using antiderivatives, making integration much more practical.\n\n# # # Section 3.3: Basic Integration Techniques\n\nCommon integration formulas:\n- ∫ x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1)\n- ∫ 1/x dx = ln|x| + C\n- ∫ e^x dx = e^x + C\n- ∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n- ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C\n\nThese basic forms can be combined with techniques like substitution and integration by parts for more complex problems.\n",
