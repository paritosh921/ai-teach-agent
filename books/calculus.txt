## Chapter 1: Limits and Continuity
Understanding Limits

The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus. A limit describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a particular value. 

Consider the function f(x) = x². As x approaches 2, what happens to f(x)? We can see that f(x) approaches 4. We write this as:

lim(x→2) x² = 4

The formal definition uses epsilon-delta notation, but intuitively, we're asking: "What value does f(x) get arbitrarily close to as x gets arbitrarily close to some number a?"

Section 1.2: Limit Laws

Limits follow several important rules:
1. Sum Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) + g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) + lim(x→a) g(x)
2. Product Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) × g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) × lim(x→a) g(x)
3. Quotient Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) / g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) / lim(x→a) g(x), provided lim(x→a) g(x) ≠ 0

These rules allow us to break down complex limit problems into simpler parts.

 Section 2.1: The Derivative as a Limit

# Introduction: What is a Derivative?

The derivative is a fundamental concept in calculus.

At its core, it measures how a function changes as its input changes.
In real life, it often represents speed, growth rate, or the slope of a curve at a specific point.

Example intuition:
The speedometer in a car shows how fast the position is changing right now - that is an instantaneous rate of change, i.e., a derivative.

 Definition (Formal Limit Form)

The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x is defined as:

f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h

Here:
- h is a very small change in x
- The fraction represents average rate of change over the interval [x, x+h]
- The limit as h approaches 0 gives us the instantaneous rate of change
## Geometrical Meaning

On a graph of y = f(x):
- The average rate of change is the slope of a secant line through two points
- The derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a single point

So:
f'(x) = Slope of the tangent line at point (x, f(x))

## Worked Example

Let's compute the derivative of f(x) = x².

f'(x) = lim(h→0) [(x+h)² - x²]/h

Step by step:
= lim(h→0) [x² + 2xh + h² - x²]/h
= lim(h→0) [2xh + h²]/h
= lim(h→0) (2x + h)
= 2x

So, f'(x) = 2x.
This means the slope of y = x² at any point x is 2x.

# Interpretation with Numbers

If f(x) = x²:
- At x = 1, f'(1) = 2 (Slope is 2)
- At x = 2, f'(2) = 4 (Slope is 4)
- At x = 0, f'(0) = 0 (Tangent is flat)

This shows how steepness changes along the curve.

## Basic Derivative Rules (from the limit definition)

From repeated calculations like above, we can generalize:

1. Power Rule:
   d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)

2. Constant Rule:
   d/dx(c) = 0

3. Constant Multiple Rule:
   d/dx(c·f(x)) = c·f'(x)

4. Sum Rule:
   d/dx(f(x) + g(x)) = f'(x) + g'(x)

## Advanced Insights

Derivatives are not only slopes - they appear in physics (velocity, acceleration), economics (marginal cost/profit), biology (growth rate), and more.

Higher-order derivatives exist:
- f''(x): slope of the slope (acceleration in physics)
- f^(n)(x): the nth derivative

 Summary for Students

- The derivative is the instantaneous rate of change
- Defined using a limit process
- Geometrically: slope of tangent line
- First principles: f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)]/h
- Leads to useful rules like the power rule

 Section 2.2: Power Rule

The power rule states that for any function f(x) = x^n where n is a real number:

f'(x) = n × x^(n-1)

This is one of the most fundamental differentiation rules. Examples:
- If f(x) = x³, then f'(x) = 3x²
- If f(x) = x^(1/2), then f'(x) = (1/2)x^(-1/2)
- If f(x) = 1/x = x^(-1), then f'(x) = -x^(-2)

# # Section 2.3: Applications of Derivatives

Derivatives have many practical applications:
1. Finding velocity from position (physics)
2. Optimization problems (finding maxima and minima)
3. Related rates problems
4. Curve sketching and analysis

# # Chapter 3: Integration

# ## Section 3.1: Antiderivatives

An antiderivative of a function f(x) is a function F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x). 

For example, since d/dx[x²] = 2x, we know that x² is an antiderivative of 2x.

The general antiderivative includes a constant of integration:
∫ 2x dx = x² + C

### Section 3.2: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

This theorem connects differentiation and integration. It states that if f is continuous on [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f, then:

∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

This allows us to evaluate definite integrals using antiderivatives, making integration much more practical.

# # # Section 3.3: Basic Integration Techniques

Common integration formulas:
- ∫ x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1)
- ∫ 1/x dx = ln|x| + C
- ∫ e^x dx = e^x + C
- ∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C
- ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C

These basic forms can be combined with techniques like substitution and integration by parts for more complex problems.
