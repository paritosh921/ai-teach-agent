# Introduction to Calculus

## Chapter 1: Limits and Continuity

### Section 1.1: Understanding Limits

The concept of a limit is fundamental to calculus. A limit describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a particular value. 

Consider the function f(x) = x². As x approaches 2, what happens to f(x)? We can see that f(x) approaches 4. We write this as:

lim(x→2) x² = 4

The formal definition uses epsilon-delta notation, but intuitively, we're asking: "What value does f(x) get arbitrarily close to as x gets arbitrarily close to some number a?"

### Section 1.2: Limit Laws

Limits follow several important rules:
1. Sum Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) + g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) + lim(x→a) g(x)
2. Product Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) × g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) × lim(x→a) g(x)
3. Quotient Rule: lim(x→a) [f(x) / g(x)] = lim(x→a) f(x) / lim(x→a) g(x), provided lim(x→a) g(x) ≠ 0

These rules allow us to break down complex limit problems into simpler parts.

## Chapter 2: Derivatives

### Section 2.1: The Derivative as a Limit

The derivative represents the instantaneous rate of change of a function. It's defined as:

f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

Geometrically, this represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve at point x.

For example, if f(x) = x², then:
f'(x) = lim(h→0) [(x+h)² - x²] / h
      = lim(h→0) [x² + 2xh + h² - x²] / h
      = lim(h→0) [2xh + h²] / h
      = lim(h→0) [2x + h]
      = 2x

### Section 2.2: Power Rule

The power rule states that for any function f(x) = x^n where n is a real number:

f'(x) = n × x^(n-1)

This is one of the most fundamental differentiation rules. Examples:
- If f(x) = x³, then f'(x) = 3x²
- If f(x) = x^(1/2), then f'(x) = (1/2)x^(-1/2)
- If f(x) = 1/x = x^(-1), then f'(x) = -x^(-2)

### Section 2.3: Applications of Derivatives

Derivatives have many practical applications:
1. Finding velocity from position (physics)
2. Optimization problems (finding maxima and minima)
3. Related rates problems
4. Curve sketching and analysis

## Chapter 3: Integration

### Section 3.1: Antiderivatives

An antiderivative of a function f(x) is a function F(x) such that F'(x) = f(x). 

For example, since d/dx[x²] = 2x, we know that x² is an antiderivative of 2x.

The general antiderivative includes a constant of integration:
∫ 2x dx = x² + C

### Section 3.2: The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

This theorem connects differentiation and integration. It states that if f is continuous on [a,b] and F is an antiderivative of f, then:

∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

This allows us to evaluate definite integrals using antiderivatives, making integration much more practical.

### Section 3.3: Basic Integration Techniques

Common integration formulas:
- ∫ x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1)
- ∫ 1/x dx = ln|x| + C
- ∫ e^x dx = e^x + C
- ∫ sin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C
- ∫ cos(x) dx = sin(x) + C

These basic forms can be combined with techniques like substitution and integration by parts for more complex problems.
