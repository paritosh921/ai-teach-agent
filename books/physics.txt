# Introduction to Physics

## Chapter 1: Motion in One Dimension

### Section 1.1: Position, Velocity, and Acceleration

Motion is fundamental to physics. We describe motion using three key concepts:

**Position (x)**: The location of an object relative to a reference point. Position can be positive or negative depending on the chosen coordinate system.

**Velocity (v)**: The rate of change of position with respect to time. Average velocity is defined as:
v_avg = Δx/Δt = (x₂ - x₁)/(t₂ - t₁)

Instantaneous velocity is the limit as Δt approaches zero:
v = dx/dt

**Acceleration (a)**: The rate of change of velocity with respect to time:
a_avg = Δv/Δt = (v₂ - v₁)/(t₂ - t₁)

Instantaneous acceleration:
a = dv/dt = d²x/dt²

### Section 1.2: Kinematic Equations

For motion with constant acceleration, we have five kinematic equations:

1. v = v₀ + at
2. x = x₀ + v₀t + ½at²
3. v² = v₀² + 2a(x - x₀)
4. x = x₀ + ½(v₀ + v)t
5. x = x₀ + vt - ½at²

Where:
- x₀ = initial position
- v₀ = initial velocity  
- v = final velocity
- a = acceleration (constant)
- t = time

### Section 1.3: Free Fall

Free fall is a special case of motion with constant acceleration where a = -g = -9.8 m/s² (on Earth).

Key characteristics:
- All objects fall at the same rate (ignoring air resistance)
- Velocity increases linearly with time
- Distance fallen increases quadratically with time

For an object dropped from rest at height h:
- Time to fall: t = √(2h/g)
- Final velocity: v = √(2gh)

## Chapter 2: Forces and Newton's Laws

### Section 2.1: Newton's First Law (Law of Inertia)

An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by a net external force.

This law defines inertia - the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion. It also establishes the concept of inertial reference frames.

### Section 2.2: Newton's Second Law

The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass:

F_net = ma

This is the most important equation in classical mechanics. It tells us:
- Greater force produces greater acceleration
- Greater mass produces less acceleration for the same force
- Force and acceleration are vector quantities (same direction)

### Section 2.3: Newton's Third Law

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

More precisely: If object A exerts a force F_AB on object B, then object B exerts a force F_BA on object A, where F_BA = -F_AB.

Important notes:
- Action-reaction pairs act on different objects
- They are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction
- They occur simultaneously

### Section 2.4: Common Forces

**Weight**: W = mg (always points downward)

**Normal Force**: Perpendicular contact force from a surface

**Friction**: 
- Static friction: f_s ≤ μ_s N
- Kinetic friction: f_k = μ_k N

**Tension**: Force transmitted through a string or rope

**Applied Force**: Any external force applied to an object

## Chapter 3: Energy and Work

### Section 3.1: Work

Work is done when a force causes displacement:

W = F⋅d = Fd cos θ

Where θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors.

Key points:
- Work is a scalar quantity
- Units: Joules (J) = N⋅m
- Work can be positive, negative, or zero
- Only the component of force in the direction of motion does work

### Section 3.2: Kinetic Energy

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion:

KE = ½mv²

The work-energy theorem states:
W_net = ΔKE = KE_f - KE_i

This powerful theorem connects force and motion through energy concepts.

### Section 3.3: Potential Energy

Potential energy is stored energy due to position or configuration.

**Gravitational Potential Energy**: PE_g = mgh
(measured from a reference level)

**Elastic Potential Energy**: PE_s = ½kx²
(for a spring with spring constant k compressed or stretched by distance x)

### Section 3.4: Conservation of Energy

In the absence of non-conservative forces (like friction), mechanical energy is conserved:

E = KE + PE = constant

This principle allows us to solve many problems without considering forces directly, making it a powerful problem-solving tool.
