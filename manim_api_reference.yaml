  # Common mistakes to avoid
  common_mistakes:
    - mistake: "Using ShowCreation"
      correct: "Use Create instead"
      
    - mistake: "Not clearing objects between sections"
      correct: "Use FadeOut or self.clear()"
      
    - mistake: "Overlapping text"
      correct: "Use proper positioning with next_to() or move_to()"
      
    - mistake: "Missing run_time parameter"
      correct: "Add run_time=2 for controlled timing"
      
  # Best practices for educational animations
  best_practices:
    timing:
      - "Use run_time parameter for consistent pacing"
      - "Add self.wait() between major concepts"
      - "Keep individual animations 1-3 seconds"
      
    layout:
      - "Position elements in consistent regions" 
      - "Leave space between objects"
      - "Use layers: background, main content, highlights"
      
    transitions:
      - "Clear previous elements before new sections"
      - "Use FadeOut for smooth transitions"
      - "Group related animations with AnimationGroup"
      
    educational_flow:
      - "Introduce concept → Show visual → Explain → Practice"
      - "Build complexity gradually"
      - "Use consistent visual metaphors"
