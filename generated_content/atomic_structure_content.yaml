  conclusion:
    key_takeaway: Atoms, though incredibly small, make up everything we see in the
      universe. Their structure - protons, neutrons, and electrons in specific arrangements
      - gives them unique properties.
    summary_points:
    - Atoms are the building blocks of matter
    - They consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons
    - Electrons inhabit energy levels or shells
    - Atomic number and atomic mass define different atoms

    narration: Atoms are the smallest unit of matter that retains the properties of
      an element. They were first theorized by ancient Greeks and later confirmed
      by scientists.
